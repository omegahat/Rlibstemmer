Title: Interface to Snowball implementation of Porter's word stemming algorithm using libstemmer.
Description: An R interface to the C code that implements Porter's
  word stemming algorithm for collapsing words to a common root
  to aid comparison of texts.  There is code to for 16 different
  languages (i.e. danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german,
  hungarian, italian,  norwegian, portuguese, romanian, russian,
